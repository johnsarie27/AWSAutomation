# Contributing Guide

- For minor fixes such as a typo, a simple pull request is all that's needed. For more involved changes, please follow the process laid out below.
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Focus on updating a single function/cmdlet in a Pull Request to make the review processes simpler for the core team.

To propose changes to the existing functions or the creation of a new one, the process is as follows:

1. Create a new [issue](https://github.com/johnsarie27/AWSAutomation/issues/new/choose) using either:
   - The `new_function_proposal` template if you want to propose a new function.
   - The `update_function_proposal` template if you want to modify a existing function.
2. Create a new issue
3. Once the issue has been discussed and approved:
    1. Clone this repository.
    2. Create a new branch.
    3. Either:
        - Create the page using the [new function template](templates/new-function.md).
        - Modify the target function in case of an update or refactor.
    4. Submit your [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Style Guide

### Content

The intended purpose of the functions in this module are internal functionality within the secure boundaries, specfically within virtual machines. There should be no dependency on outside libraries.

### Structure

- Start with this general structure

```pwsh
function <FunctionName> {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        
    .DESCRIPTION
       
    .INPUTS
        
    .OUTPUTS
        
    .EXAMPLE
        
    .NOTES
    #>

    [CmdletBinding()]
    Param()
}
```

- Only use approved verbs when naming functions
- Function must include properly defined help

## How to get started contributing

Follow these steps:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the file [Project.code-workspace](project.code-workspace) from VSCode via the menu `File > Open Workspace...`.
3. You should be prompted to open the workspace in a dev container. If you are not prompted, open the Command Palette and search for "Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container". When complete, you should be connected to the development container as if it was your local machine.
4. You are ready to contribute :+1:

>:alarm_clock: What to verify before pushing the updates?

1. Ensure your changes are passing PSScriptAnalyzer and Pester tests.

    ```pwsh
    ./Build/build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -TaskList Test # run pester
    ./Build/build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -TaskList Analyze # run psscriptanalyzer
    ```

2. Ensure you have generated documentation for your function. The below command will generate a Staging folder in the root of the project with an exact copy of the repo, including generated documentation in markdown. It will then copy that generated documentation into the proper location ready to commit.

    ```pwsh
    ./Build/build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -TaskList CopyDocumentation # build documentation
    ```

    - :heavy_exclamation_mark: Do NOT commit the Staging or Artifacts directories as they are only for testing purposes. You can safely delete them when testing is complete with the following command.

    ```pwsh
    ./Build/build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -TaskList Cleanup
    ```

## Release

This project also includes the necessary tools to automate the release of the module via GitHub Actions. The file [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) handles this task.

To create a new release of the module, first update the module manifest with the necessary version number and commit that to the main branch. Then, create a new tag with the same version number and push it to GitHub. This will start the build process and publish a new version of the module to the repo.
